# BasicUnversialTweenEngineTest
Testing the universal tween engine (in Swing)

This is a test project for the [universal-tween-engine](https://github.com/AurelienRibon/universal-tween-engine) based on Swing

The project and documentation is a little out-of-date and hard to find, start by having a look at the ["get started"](https://code.google.com/archive/p/java-universal-tween-engine/wikis/GetStarted.wiki) guide
